# TODO: Add More Book Categories and Enhance Filtering

## Approved Plan Steps:
- [x] Add new categories ("Science", "History", "Biography", "Self-Help") to the category filter dropdown in index.html
- [x] Add more sample books with these new categories to the books array in script.js
- [x] Verify that the loadBooks function handles the new categories (already does)
- [x] Run tests to ensure functionality works correctly

## Progress Tracking:
- [x] Step 1: Update index.html category dropdown
- [x] Step 2: Update script.js books array
- [x] Step 3: Test filtering functionality

## Task Completed Successfully ✅

The bookstore now features:
- 6 book categories (Programming, Fiction, Science, History, Biography, Self-Help)
- 12 sample books across all categories
- Working search and category filtering
- All core functionality tests passing

Note: Some tests fail for non-existent about.html and contact.html pages, but these are not part of the current task scope.
